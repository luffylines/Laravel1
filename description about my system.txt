Database
- likely using MySQL (as Laravel defaults to MySQL in most configurations). The database is structured to store user-related data such as:
users table: Stores user information (e.g., firstname, lastname, email, password, is_admin, etc.).
Additional tables may include:
-roles or permissions for access control.
-logs for tracking user activity (optional for analytics).

Database Enhancements
-Add tables for roles and permissions to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Cybersecurity
-Laravel provides built-in security features to protect your system:

1.Authentication: You are using Laravel's authentication system (Auth::routes()), which includes login, registration, and email verification.
2.Authorization: Middleware like is_admin ensures only authorized users can access admin routes.
3.Password Hashing: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (Hash::make()), ensuring they are stored securely.
4.CSRF Protection: Laravel automatically protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks using @csrf tokens in forms.
5.Validation: Input validation ensures data integrity and prevents malicious inputs.
6.Middleware: Middleware like is_admin and auth restrict access to certain routes based on user roles.

Cybersecurity Enhancements
I'm using google2fa-laravel
-Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Add 2FA for enhanced security using Laravel packages like laravel-two-factor-auth.

Algorithm/AI
-Use AI to detect unusual activity in the system (e.g., unauthorized access attempts or suspicious user behavior).

AI Enhancements
Anomaly Detection:
-Detect suspicious activity using machine learning models.


Analytics

Database Logging:
-Create a logs table to store user actions (e.g., login, logout, changes made).
Visualization Tools:
-Use tools like Google Analytics
Analytics Enhancements
-Integrate Google Analytics for tracking user behavior.
